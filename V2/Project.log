Model "nmos12": Oxide thickness thinner than recommended for a level 1 MOSFET.
Instance "m2": Length shorter than recommended for a level 1 MOSFET.
Instance "m1": Length shorter than recommended for a level 1 MOSFET.
Early termination of direct N-R iteration.
Direct Newton iteration failed to find .op point.  (Use ".option noopiter" to skip.)
